## Fluent Binding API (Future)

We are working on providing a simple fluent API like:

```csharp
button.BindSafeClicked(handler);
```

Which internally would use the BulletproofEventAdapter.

## Adapter Caching

For performance in large applications, it is possible to cache adapters per control instance if needed.

## Custom EventArgs Types

Currently, BulletproofEventAdapter assumes `EventHandler` signatures. In future versions, support for custom `EventArgs` types will be added using generics.
