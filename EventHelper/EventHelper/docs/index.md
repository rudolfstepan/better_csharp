# EventHelper Documentation

Welcome to **EventHelper**, your new standard for bulletproof event management in .NET and MAUI projects!

## Welcome

**EventHelper** was born out of the need for safer, smarter event handling in C#.

Traditional event systems in .NET are prone to:
- Memory leaks due to strong references.
- Multiple event handler registrations ("bouncing" issues).
- Complex and error-prone cleanup in dynamic UIs.

**EventHelper** addresses these issues head-on:
- Memory-safe with **WeakReferences**.
- Prevents **duplicate event registrations**.
- Automatic **event unsubscription** when handlers are removed.
- Fully compatible with existing MAUI and .NET event patterns.

EventHelper brings safety, clarity, and performance to your UI applications.
